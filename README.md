# Literally Just Stairs
A minecraft datapack which changes the stair recipe to be more realistic.

<h1>Reasoning</h1>
<br>
<p>My reasoning for this stems from the fact that a minecraft stair is exactly 3/4 of a block. This means that if you put in 6 planks, as the recipe requires, 6 * 3/4 = 8, so you should receive 8 stairs.</p>
